ques 1:- Add two Numbers You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers.<br>

Ans:-
  <br> const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {<br>
    return a+b;<br>
};<br><br>


ques 2:-  Find if the conditions are obeyed or not? You are given two number first as A and second as B and check if both conditions 
(A<10 and A>B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.<br>

Ans:-  
<br>
    const Is_Valid = (a,b) => {<br>
        return(a<10)&&(a>b)? true:false<br>
        };<br><br>


ques 3:-  Check the conditons You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:
1.if both are divisible by 10 console true.<br>
2.if both are not divisible by 10 console false.<br>
3.if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true.<br>
Use operator to do this.<br>

Ans:-
<br>
    const Check = (A, B) => <br>
    {<br>
      
     if(A%10 ==0 && B%10 ==0){<br>
      return true;<br>
    }<br>
      else if(A%10 !=0&& B%10 !=0){<br>
        return false;<br>
    }    
    else{<br>
      return true;<br>
    }<br>
    };<br><br>

    
ques 4:-Find the first digit of a 4 digit number
You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the first digit of that number.<br>

Ans:-
<br>
const First_Digit = (n) => {<br>
    while(n>=10)<br>
    n/=10;<br>
    return Math.floor(n); <br> 
  };<br><br>
  

ques 5:-Find the last digit of a 4 digit number
You are provided a four digit number N only. Your task is to print out the last digit of that number.<br>

Ans:-
<br>
const Last_Digit = (n) => {<br>
    return n%10;<br>
  };<br><br>


ques 6:- Find the remainder You are provided with two numbers A and B where A as divisor and B as dividend.
Your task is find the remainder<br>

Ans:-
<br>
const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {<br>
    a=b%a;<br>
    return a;<br>
 };<br><br>

ques 7:- Multipy two Numbers You are provided with two numbers A and B. 
Your task is to multiply these two numbers<br>

Ans:-
<br>
const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {<br>
    a*=b;   //a=a*b<br>
    return a;<br>
};<br><br>

ques 8:- Marks Calculator  Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A, B, and C (out of 100).
Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average.<br>

Ans:-
<br>
const Sum = (A, B, C) => <br>
{<br>
 return(A+B+C);<br>
};<br>

const Average = (A, B, C) =><br> 
{<br>
 return(A+B+C)/3;<br>
};<br><br>
